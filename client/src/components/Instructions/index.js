      <h2> Explorer!</h2>
        <p> Welcome and thank you for playing Explorer!  We hope you are able to have a wonderful timing learning about the splendors that are our planet and solar system.  In order to help you get the most of our exciting game, we wanted to share key instructions with you. </p>
      <h1> Create/Login </h1>
        <p>  On our initial landing page, you will be greated with the option to sign into the game or create a new account.  If you have played before, please input the email and password that you used to create that account.  If you have not yet created an account, simply hit the create account button.  You will then be prompted to input your email address and the password you choose.  That's it!</p>
      <h1> Game Menu</h1>
        <p> After creating an account and logging into the game, you will be able to hit play button and enter the game menu.  In this menu, you will be able to choose between viewing and managing your character, exploring and learning about the Earth and solar system and earning money by answer quiz questions about the Earth and solar system.  Simply click on the option you would like to persue.</p>
      <h1> Character Creation </h1>
        <p>  If you have not yet created a character, you will be prompted to do so when you first enter the manage character screen.  You will need to create a character so that you information will be saved.  In the character create screen you can input your name and age.  You can then choose from available pictures.  Simply click to see the next picture until you find one that you like.  Finally hit create.</p>
      <h1> Character Management </h1>
       <p> After creating a character you can now manage your character.  In this screen you will see your flying license along with statistics about your game.  Furthermore, you will be able to purchase ships that you can then use to traverse the game.  Upon initial creation, you will be given enough money to buy the first ship.  You will need this in order to explore the first level.  Then, as you earn money through answering quiz questions, you will be able to purchase new ships.  After purchasing these ships, you will be able to advance in level up to your highest ship model.</p>
      <h1> Explore and Learn </h1>
      <p> In the Explore and Learn section of the game, you will be able to navigate through the level and learn exciting information of the world and solar system you live in.  Note that a plane or ship will be displayed on the screen depending on what level you are in.  You can then click anywhere on the map to get your ship to move to this new location.  If you then hit "l", a new screen will be displayed giving you a wealth of information about the location you are currently at.  You can close this screen by pressin "l" again so that you can travel elsewhere and learn more. In addition to being able to view your location, you can also bring up your character stats by pressing "c" and an options menu by pressing "o". </p>
      <p> If you would like to explore a different area, simply click the previous level or next level buttons at the top of the page.  Note that, however, you will only be able to go to level if you own the ship needed for that level.  You can't fly around space in an airplane after all.  If you need to earn more money to buy a ship, you can press the earn money button at the top in order to go to the earn section of the game.</p>  
      <h1> Earn</h1>
      <p> As previously mentioned, you will need to earn money in order to buy a ship so that you can travel to new exciting places.  You do this by going to the earn page.  When there, you will be able to choose between a wide range of topics that you could have seen while exploring.  If you choose one of these topics, you will then be presented with questions related to that topic.  For each answer you get right, you will earn money!  At the end of the quiz, the number correct and amount of money earned will be displayed.</p>
      <h1> Have fun!</h1>
